    "When trying to find the best places to live, it's always a good idea to compare cities and if possible, to compare neighborhoods. After all, when you go to buy a car or a house or any big ticket item, you usually try out a few models or visit a few homes before you decide. The same tactic applies to finding the best places to live. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways that can help you asses different factors when comparing two cities, some are listed as following:\n",
    "1. **Overall Comparison**: This is a comparison of the same factors for each city, resulting in having a general overview of the two cities. Some of the popular factors include population, cost of living, average rent, crime rate, tax rates, and air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Crime Rates**: Here, the comparison is made to know the crime rates of two cities, then measures them both against the national statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost of Living and Salary Comparison**: This takes into account comparing salaries and cost of living within cities for a decision to be made. Some factors for this comparison includes statistics on food, housing, utilities, transportation and more. This is a useful way to find out if your salary will measure up in the new city.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare Schools**: This is helpful in finding the best school in a vicinity by doing a comparison between different places. It mostly takes into consideration test scores and teacher and student ratios, including the teacher's experience of the lists schools in the city of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Neighborhood Comparison**: This looks at neighborhood comparison and helps one choose the best place to live within any given city. These sites allow you to see some pretty interesting facts about the various communities."
